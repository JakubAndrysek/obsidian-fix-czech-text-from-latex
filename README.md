# Fix Czech text generated by LaTeX ("v pˇr´ıpadˇe" → "v případě")

This plugin is designed to correct common encoding issues in Czech texts, particularly those copied from LaTeX presentations. It automatically converts characters like '´a' to 'á', making your text more readable and correctly formatted.

## Features

2. **Fix Entire Document**: Apply the fix to the entire current document.
3. **Fix Clipboard Text and Insert**: Read text from the clipboard, fix it, and insert it at the current cursor position in the document.

## Usage
